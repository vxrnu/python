Once upon a time there was a small village.
The village was peaceful and quiet.
Children played by the river.
Elders told stories under the old oak tree.
The fields grew wheat and barley in the summer.
Cows grazed in the meadows nearby.
In winter, the snow covered every roof and path.
The villagers gathered in the hall for warmth.
Festivals were held in spring to celebrate life.
Everyone helped each other in times of need.
One day, a big storm arrived suddenly.
The wind blew fiercely across the fields.
Trees bent and branches fell to the ground.
The villagers rushed to protect their homes.
Animals were led to the barns for safety.
For hours the storm raged without pause.
Finally, the storm passed and silence returned.
The sun broke through the clouds again.
Slowly, life returned to the small village.
The people were thankful for peace once more.
